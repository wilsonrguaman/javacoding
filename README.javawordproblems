Java code problems: 

I try to provide on every example program includes the description of the program, Java code as well as output of the program. All examples are compiled and tested
using IDE G-grasp.
The reason I like using G-grasp is because it forces you to remember certain keywords. I believe this is the best way to learn a new programming language.
In these coding examples you can find basic coding examples programs and advanced Java programs using arrays.

Note: I am still working on providing the full description for all java programs.
